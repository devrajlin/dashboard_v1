# Dashboard


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Get started with the Dashboard

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

-> Make sure you have apache2 running in your system.
-> Make sure you have node js installed in your system and run the file with command node app.js which was located in project/api/app.js
-> Then place all files in one folder called 'project' and place that folder in your localhost and access the link localhost/project

```

## Versioning

This is the first version of our dashboard and there will be little errors cause work is still in progress.
